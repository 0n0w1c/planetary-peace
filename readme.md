#### Planetary Peace

Provides a shortcut to toggle peaceful mode, per planet.

When the shortcut is active (yellow), enemy units are peaceful unless provoked.  
When the shortcut is inactive (gray), enemy units are hostile.

Each planet (surface) maintains its own peaceful state.

Exception: Demolishers on Vulcanus are not affected by peaceful mode!  

*Controls*
